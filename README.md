# Web Development Practice Exercises

This repository contains a collection of simple to intermediate web development-related exercises to help me master the fundamentals of web development. I created these as personal learning projects and committed them to track my progress.

## Folder Structure

- `tables/` â€” Exercises focused on HTML tables

## Why This Repo?

I wanted to:

- Track my progress over time.
- Practice and understand HTML structure deeply (frontend development)
- Build a strong Git + GitHub workflow.
- Build a strong foundation before working on real-world large projects

## What's Next?
I plan to add more practice folders like:
- `mini-projects/`

ðŸ“Œ As, I believe learning by doing is the best way forward. Every day, I push a little further.
