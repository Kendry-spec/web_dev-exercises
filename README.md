# Web Development Practice Exercises

This repo is where I keep my web development exercises as I practice and build up my understanding of the basics. It's a personal learning project that helps me track my progress along the way.

## Folder Structure

- `css_navbar/`
- `html_tables/` â€” Exercises focused on HTML tables
- `z-index-examples/`

## Why This Repo?

I wanted to:

- Track my progress over time.
- Practice and understand HTML structure deeply (frontend development)
- Build a strong Git + GitHub workflow.
- Build a strong foundation before working on real-world large projects

## What's Next?
I plan to add more practice folders containing real Projects.

ðŸ“Œ As, I believe learning by doing is the best way forward. Every day, I push a little further.
